# RawMats UML Diagrams
The Architecture Document of RawMats contains diagrams constructed using UML, specifically **PlantUML**. To track changes in these diagrams, this repository contains each files and its history.

## Dependencies
**Visual Studio Code**
**UML Viewer Extension for VS Code**
**Java (Determinant)**

Java may only be needed if you are rendering these diagrams directly using the terminal. For our use case, we found that extensions like **Rich PlantUML Viewer** was sufficient in viewing our diagrams.
